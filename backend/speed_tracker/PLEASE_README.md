# SpeedTracker Folder

This folder is intended for projects and scripts related to speed tracking and estimation using various computer vision tools.

## Vehicle Speed Estimation with Traffic Cameras

Ultralytics, in combination with Roboflow and Supervision, can be utilized to estimate the speed of vehicles using traffic cameras. These tools provide a powerful framework for building and deploying computer vision models for speed estimation.

### Resources

For a proof of concept (POC) and detailed guidance, refer to the following resources:

- [Roboflow Supervision Speed Estimation Example](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/tree/develop/examples/speed_estimation)
- [Google Colab: How to Estimate Vehicle Speed with Computer Vision](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/how-to-estimate-vehicle-speed-with-computer-vision.ipynb)

These resources offer comprehensive tutorials and example code to get started with vehicle speed estimation using traffic camera footage.
