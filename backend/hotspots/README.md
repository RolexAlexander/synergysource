# Hotspots Prediction System

This folder contains the code for predicting and plotting passenger request hotspots on a map. The goal is to allow companies to better plan and allocate resources by predicting where and when passengers are most likely to request rides.

## Overview

The Hotspots Prediction System uses geospatial regression techniques to analyze ride request data based on location (latitude and longitude) and time of day. By training a model with this data, the system can predict future hotspots, helping companies optimize their operations.

### Key Components

- **Algorithm**: The system uses spatial regression (or geospatial regression) to model the relationship between the latitude, longitude, time of day, and the number of ride requests. This allows us to predict where and when ride requests will be concentrated, identifying potential hotspots.
  
- **Dummy Data**: The `train.py` script generates dummy data for the purpose of training and testing the algorithm. This includes random latitude, longitude, and time of day values, along with a target variable representing the number of ride requests.

- **Visualization**: After training the model, the system plots the predicted hotspots on a map, providing a visual representation of where the highest concentrations of ride requests are expected.

## How to Run

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the required Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas geopandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Step 2: Train the Model

The `train.py` script is used to train the model on dummy data and plot the predicted hotspots:

```bash
python train.py
```

### Step 3: View the Results

After running `train.py`, a map will be displayed showing the predicted hotspots. The size of the red markers indicates the intensity of the predicted ride requests.

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation uses dummy data, the model can be enhanced by feeding it with real-world data, including actual ride request logs. This will improve the accuracy of the predictions and make the system more applicable to real-world scenarios.

Additionally, more sophisticated models, such as those utilizing time series analysis or deep learning, can be integrated to further improve prediction accuracy.
